# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, follow the intructions to run the project (after ensuring nodejs - latest stable version and npm are installed):

### `git clone https://github.com/afreen77/quote-app.git`
### `cd quote-app`
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

### `npm test`
Test setup is available and a introductory test is written for Header component.
However more tests needs to be added.

### TODO
* unit tests and functional tests needs to be added.
* styles can be improved.
